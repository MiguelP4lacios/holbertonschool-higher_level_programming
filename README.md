## About The Project üöß
**High Level Languages**

High level abstraction languages are used in the most of the companies in the tech industry. Due to this languages are similar to english it easy the developers job to accomplish with complex task in few amount of time.

## How to use them
This projects works with interpreter languages so you dont need to compille anything. To use the scripts or programs inside, its required to have installed python 3.4.3, MyQSL 5.7 and Node 10.14

## Python üìÇ
Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace.

## SQL MySQL and Data Bases Management with Python üìÇ
When you are using a program all the state of it stored in the ram memory, but this is for temporal use which mean that if you leave current execution, you will lose your current state. In some cases you will need to store the states of your execution and that is achieved by using DataBases which save the information in the hard disk so that you can get it premanently.
